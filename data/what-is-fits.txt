FITS is a file format commonly used in astronomy for storing and exchanging scientific data. 
The FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) format is designed to be used for the storage, transmission, and processing of scientific data, particularly astronomical and astrophysical data. 
It supports various types of data, including images, tables, and multi-dimensional arrays.

FITS files typically consist of a header section and a data section. 
The header contains metadata information such as the observation date, telescope parameters, and other relevant details. 
The data section contains the actual scientific data, which can include images, spectra, or other types of data.

Due to its flexibility and support for metadata, FITS has become a widely adopted standard in the field of astronomy for sharing and archiving data. 
Astronomical observatories and research institutions commonly use FITS files to store and exchange data obtained from telescopes and other observation instruments.
