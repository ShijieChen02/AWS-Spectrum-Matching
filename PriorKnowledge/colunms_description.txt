 (a) flux is light intensity at a given wavelength. It is theoretically nonnegative, but with
 noise it can be negative.
 (b) loglam is log(x=wavelength, base=10), so wavelength = 10^loglam.
 (c) ivar (“inverse variance”) is an estimated variance of the ith flux. (Each
 spectrum is constructed from several observations and each flux[i] value is an average
 of several underlying measurements)
 (d) and_mask is 0 for a good observation. We could exclude data with nonzero and_mask.
 (Masks flag problems in the data. and_mask indicates whether there is bad data at this
 (wavelength, flux) pixel in all observations.)
 (e) or_mask is 0 for a good observation. We can ignore it. (It says there is bad data at this
 pixel in at least one observation.)
 (f) wdisp is the resolution of the spectrograph at that wavelength. We can ignore it, but 
we want to keep it.
 (g) sky is the spectrum of the sky, mostly already subtracted out from flux. We can ignore
 it, but we want to keep it. (Some search algorithms may need to mask out +/-5 pixels 
 around 5577 Angstroms to avoid spurious matches to a strong emission line due to 
 Earth’s atmosphere.)
